  summary: Stop plotting your data - annotate your data and let it visualize itself.
  description: |
    HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis
    and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually
    express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on
    what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting.
